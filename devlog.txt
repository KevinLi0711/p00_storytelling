collected feedback on design_wiki:
    - History of all edits could be displayed as a separate component from the main page.
    - Editing mode for the entire page of the wiki, as opposed to editing individually paragraphs separately.

kevinL -- 2022-11-02 21:24
changed some word choices in design.pdf and clarified some parts that were found to be confusing
updated the front end site map to include a create button and the page it leads to

matthewY -- 2022-11-07 13:20
copied login / logout code from 19_session as a base for this project

kevinL -- 2022-11-08 20:46
created testing.py to experiment with sqlite and document useful code bits 
created users.db and inserted the following records for testing purposes
    - karate, 1234
    - Kevin, Li

josephW -- 2022-11-08 21:19
created register.html and a register url in order to create a register page. 
- linked login page and register page
- flask portion of code lacking
  - missing a check of if username already in database
  - missing a way to add new username and password to database

kevinL -- 2022-11-08 22:32
created a function to search the database for records matching the data inputted into the login screen
    - but the data in cookies seem to not be getting removed?
    - turns out it was because the secret key in that file was the same as the secret key in another file

josephW -- 2022-11-09 20:14
created and made operational the register page and button back to login page.
    - page now adds users to data base if username doesn't already exist

matthewY -- 2022-11-09 20:16
added a check to prevent users from registering with whitespace in their username or password
    - page now displays an error message informing the user of whitespace prevention 
    - also prevents users from registering with an empty username or password
    - discovered that db.commit() is necessary to save changes to database

kevinL -- 2022-11-09 20:25
added more users into users.db as a result of testing:
    - Matthew, Yee
    - Joseph, Wu

matthewY -- 2022-11-10 13:19
created a home page and changed a line in login() to redirect to this new page upon logging in

josephW -- 2022-11-10 13:19
created a button to return the user to the home page
created a button on the registration page to return to the login page

kevinL -- 2022-11-11 20:25
replaced f strings in sqlite queries with ? substitutions
    - found out that these substitutions require a tuple parameter
put readme in code blocks
added a try except statement to main() that redirects the user back to the login page if they are not logged in
changed html templates to make them more distinct

matthewY -- 2002-11-13 00:50
created a page for making new stories
    - found at /create
    - page now takes a title and multi-line text as the contents of the story, and creates a table based on the title
    - populates said table with a single entry involving the contents and username of the user who created the story
    - new_story page is missing:
      - navigation back to home page
      - prevention of duplicate titles, which results in the app crashing

kevinL -- 2022-11-13 17:17
replaced more f strings in sqlite queries with ? substitutions

josephW -- 2022-11-13 17:50
created buttons to navigate to and from the story creation page to the main page
added display of stories in database on the main page

kevinL -- 2022-11-13 18:08

found out how to use for loops in jinja

kevinL -- 2022-11-13 23:17
added comments and discovered the cause behind stories not being added into the database
    - we can't use ? substitution for table names

kevinL -- 2022-11-14 01:39
changed story database structure, merging everything into one table, and fixing the problem of stories not being added into the database properly
addded additional if statements to prevent users logged in / not logged in from viewing pages they shouldn't be able to

josephW -- 2022-11-14 20:31
